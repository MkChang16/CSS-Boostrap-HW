# CSS-Boostrap-HW
This project deals with creating a Portfolio for my coding bootcamp hosted by Northwestern.

The criteria for the Portfolio lists as follows

* Functional, deployed application

* GitHub repository with README describing the project

* Navbar must be consistent on each page.

* Navbar on each page must contain links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.

* All links must work.

* Must use semantic html.

* Each page must have valid and correct HTML. (use a validation service)

* Must contain your personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)

* Must properly utilize Bootstrap components and grid system.
My project specifically utilizes HTML and CSS for the design and functionality of the website. Here on my page, you can take a peek into my life, I usually mostly military pictures to keep a uniform theme, but functionality was my main worry when working on this assignment.

I hope it fits the criteria, but I still have a lot to learn!
